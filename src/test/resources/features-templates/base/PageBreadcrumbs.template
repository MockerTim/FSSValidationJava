Feature: On both item and brand pages all breadcrumbs must go to correct links

  Scenario Outline: I will validate the navigation of the breadcrumbs
    Given I want to check the breadcrumb of "<URL>"
    When I click the link to navigate to each breadcrumb page
    Then the breadcrumb page should exist and be the correct page
    Examples:
    | URL | SCENARIO-ID |
    <LOAD_BASE_URLS>
